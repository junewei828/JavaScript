/*******************************************************************************
Write a function longestBigram(sentence) that takes in a sentence string and returns
the longest bigram in the sentence. A bigram is a pair of consecutive words.
When returning the bigram, include the space between the words.
Assume there will be no punctuation. In the case of a tie, return the earlier bigram.

Examples:

longestBigram('measure twice cut once'); // => 'measure twice'
longestBigram("One must have a mind of winter"); // => 'must have'
longestBigram("go home to eat"); // => 'go home'
longestBigram("his last assessment is fun"); // => 'last assessment'
