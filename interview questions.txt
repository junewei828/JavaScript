Tell me about yourself.

My name is June. I'm a QA engineer. I'm currently working at outward inc in San Jose, which is a 3D technology company. 
I have 3 years of QA experience. In 2016, I joined a QA bootcamp called portnov computer school in los Gatos, I learned 
basic QA mathodologies and automation skills. After that, I worked as a contracting QA engineer at Blackberry. Then I 
found my current full-time job. I've been working in current company since last July. I think bootcamp is an efficient 
way to learn a skill. I like bootcamp, because it teaches the necessary skills for a job in a very short time.

Why do you want to become a software engineer?
I work together with software engineers in my daily work. I admire software engineers a lot. I think they're smart and 
very cool because they can solve a lot of problems. Also I feel that not having sufficient knowledge about coding blocks
my way to do many stuff that I like. So I want to learn coding and become a software engineer. 


why app academy?

1. I like the curriculum in app academy; Ruby and Javascript are two popular programming languages and are easier
to learn for a beginner; and it teaches the tools that are widely used in industry; 2. App academy is a merit-based 
program, students only pay tuition after they get a job, that means both app academy and the students will try the 
best to get the most desirable skills in the job market; and app academy will provide better support to the students
than those bootcamps require upfront tuition; 3. App academy has a highly selective admission process, which makes 
sure the quality of students; so students can learn from each other and help each other.  




Web/mobile app development was a field that had always interested me.
